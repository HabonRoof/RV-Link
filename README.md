# RV-Link
This repostory is a copy of <https://gitee.com/zoomdy/RV-LINK>

If you want to download the code at the website, you'll need to regidter an account,so I copy the code and firmware to the github to avoid that.

As the name "RV-Link" imply, this project is like "BlackMagic", which can turn MCUs into JTAG device, like J-Link, and this project use GD32VF103CBT6 RISC-V architecture micro processor to do the job.

You can buy a GD32VF103CBT6 develop board at [HERE](https://stage.mapleboard.org/gd32-resc-v-nano-product-page/)
